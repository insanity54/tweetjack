## Huh?

This was a fun twitter bot project proof of concept. It is now discontinued.

Every hour, the bot would...

  * search for a random Lat/Long coordinate.
  * find a very popular tweet near that Lat/Long
  * "jack" the tweet, copying it word-for-word (technically not a retweet!)
  * post the copied tweet as an original tweet
  * ???
  * Profit
